    <p>ParaCrypt is software for encrypting and decrypting data.
      For convenience the one-time-encryption-pads are created using preshared 
      unencrypted files as sources of entropy.</p>
    <p>This software originally started as a project to better
      understand the weaknesses in the cryptography that privacy on the internet
      depends upon. Reading a little literature, poking through the cryptography
      standards documents and some cryptographic code convinced me that
      most of the standard methods are reasonably secure at the moment. However,
      they are
      all vulnerable to increases in computing power and smart cryptanalysts. The
      only provably uncrackable encryption is a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">
      one-time-pad (see Wikipedia)</a>. One-time-pads are inconvenient to use
      because they require presharing a well randomized agreed upon key that is 
      longer than what is to be encrypted. 
    </p>
    <p>Paranoid Encryption is my attempt to make this as convenient
       as possible. You still must preshare key files with your correspondent, but
       the files themselves do not have to be completely random. Your key files can
       be photos, large documents with a mixture of text and images or any other
       computer file you have handy (see more on picking key files in the
       <a href="usage.html">usage section</a>, because
       it is possible to choose bad key files). To make this work you must also 
       share with your
       correspondent a password (even better, time varying passwords). The key file
       and the password are combined to make a one-time-pad with good randomness.
       As long as the password + key file combination is not reused or compromised
       the encrypted data should be undecipherable.
