       <span class="fig_cap">Linux version of the GUI. On MacOS menus appear in 
         the normal place rather
         than in the window.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
    <p>If you installed the MacOS application you can launch it as normal by
       double-clicking on the application icon. All others continue reading.</p>
    <p>If the installation was done properly the GUI can be launched by 
       navigating to the directory containing this software and issuing the
       command: <span class="code" style="font-style:monospace">python3 wxParaCrypt.py </span>.
       If python3 is your system default you can just use "python" instead of
       "python3". The script "wxParaCrypt.py" also specifies what interpreter to use.
       Thus, if you set the executable bit in your OS, you should be able to launch
       the program directly. From the command line in *nix use something like:
       <span class="code" style="font-style:monospace">./wxParaCrypt.py </span>.
    </p>
    <p>It is also possible to create a launcher. This will depend upon which window
       manager you are using. In the lightweight Linux GUIs look for something like
       "MenuEditor" or a "Run Program..." option.

    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Choosing a Key File</div>
    <p>It is important to choose a key file that introduces unpredictable randomness.
       <span style="font-weight:bold">Avoid </span>file types that have any of the following:
       <ol>
         <li>Repetative information (patterns).</li>
         <li>Large swaths of constant values (uncompressed cartoons or other simple
             graphics: .tiff, .gif, uncompressed .png).</li>
         <li>Very simple files such as plain text files.</li>
       </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Ideal files are files with unpredictable randomness that only you and your
       correspondent have. Some examples are:
       <ul>
         <li>Photos with complex backgrounds (preferrably natural) that have not 
             been posted to the internet/cloud.</li>
         <li>Document files with a mix of text and images (preferably photos) that
             use a compressed storage format (e.g. .odt, .docx, .zip, .gzip). Compressed
             files avoid long runs of constant values.
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Because of the way the password is used to randomize the key file, even key
       files that are not very random should provide reasonable encryption. Still
       it is best to use key files with as much unpredictability as possible. This
       software makes no effort to estimate the randomness of your key file. There
       are some utility functions that can be used to judge this in the codebase,
       but they are slow and designed to be used in interactive python.
    </p>
    <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Choosing a Password</div>
    <p>Use the same rules you use for choosing a good account password. It should
       be at least 8 characters long (12 or more is better). It should contain a
       mixture of upper and lowercase letters, some numbers and symbols. <span
       style="font-weight:bold">Avoid </span> just slightly modified words or 
       phrases that can easily be guessed by someone who does a little research
       on you or your correspondent.

  <a class="anchor" name="usage_models"></a><h4>Scenarios</h4>
   <p>Although I believe this code is secure, it has not undergone any professional
      security testing. Thus even the "High Security Usage" recommendations may not
      be secure. In general this should be used as another layer of encryption
      wrapped inside standard security such as https or PGP encrypted e-mail. I
      encourage all users to read the code and let me know of issues using the
      issue tracker on the public archive website.
   </p>
   <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">High Security Usage</div>
   <p>Choose key files that meet the criteria in the section on choosing key files.
      Use strong passwords that vary in time. Preshare these with your correspondent
      as well. You should also agree on something to include in the encrypted file
      that will act as a signature so your correspondent can be sure it came from you.
      Store the key files on a removable device and do not attach this storage
      device to a network connected computer. Do all encryption on a computer or
      device that is not connected to the networks. Transfer only the encrypted
      file to the network connected computer to send to your correspondent.
      Decryption should be handled the same way. Do not resuse key file + password
      combinations.Transfer encrypted files using encrypted network protocols.
   </p>
   <div class="sub-section" style="font-style:italic">Medium Security Usage</div>
   <p>The restrictions for high security usage could be loosened a little. Rather
      then deciding ahead of time on which key file to use, the name of the key
      file for the next encrypted document could be transferred using PGP e-mail
      and a small key file that is reused with the time varying password.
   </p>
   <div class="sub-section"  style="font-style:italic">Low Security Usage</div>
   <p>Rather than using lots of private key files, share a small number of small
      key files and time varying passwords. Use these and PGP e-mail to agree on
      publicly available files as the key files. If your web traffic or your
      correspondent's web traffic is being monitored, decrypting your messages is
      reduced to guessing your password and combining that with the monitored
      downloaded files to decrypt your files.
   </p>
   <a class="anchor" name="caveats"></a><h4>Caveats (Warnings)</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>This code should not be used for archival (long-term) encryption because
        the encryption depends on
        the version of the random number generator used by Python. This may change.
    </li>
    <li>This code has not undergone a professional security review. Use at your
        own risk.
    </li>
    <li>Version 1.0 has limited error checking. It may crash if you attempt to 
        decrypt a file with the wrong keyfile or password.
    </li>
    <li>If you choose weak passwords or key files that are not adequately random
        the encryption will not be very good. Any file with large swaths of repeated
        data will be very bad, because the encryption pattern will be
        determined only by the predictable psuedo-random number generator. Files
        with patterns (especially repeating) have similar problems.
    </li>
    <li>Reusing password + key file combinations will reduce the security of your
        encryption, because cryptanalysts may be able to figure out some repeats.
        That said, if your key files are larger than the files being encrypted you
        will be somewhat protected by the fact that random chunks of the randomized
        temporary key file are used each time encryption is done. Which chunk will
        depend on the cryptographic seed provided by your computer.
